% CubeSat Web Development Workshop
% January 30th 2015

The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to the basics of web
development and version control, while attempting to simulate the
development workflow:

1. You are given a task
2. Understand the task and come up with an idea of implementing it
3. Handle the implementation details
4. Commit your changes and merge them with other changes applied while
   you were working

You will build part of the front page for the visualisation page. This
will ultimately be responsible for displaying past and current orbits
as well as a gallery of images taken.

Before starting, be sure to check your team number and work _only_ on
the corresponding assignment.


_We recommend that you use one laptop per team._

## Team 1

### Getting started

Check out a local copy of the project from GitHub.  Use the log of
committed changes to see what has been happening with the
project. Look at a diff of the latest commit.

### HTML

The provided document (`index.html`) is not fully in HTML form. Add a
title (`icy-cube` will do for now). Structure the first line of the
navigation bar.

### CSS

Use CSS to make the navbar look like the provided image.

### JavaScript

Create a canvas HTML object. Use JavaScript to set the background
image to the provided map of Earth. Then, for each point (x, y) in the
`imageCoordinates` array draw a small circle of radius 3 and centred at the
coordinates (x, y).

### Wrapping Up

Commit your changes. If you are lucky, the other team hasn't finished
their assignment so you can push your changes without merging
theirs. If not, you will have to merge their changes before hand.
